% COMPLINACE_GUI_V1 M-file for Complinace_GUI_v1.fig
%      COMPLINACE_GUI_V1, by itself, creates a new COMPLINACE_GUI_V1 or raises the existing
%      singleton*.
%
%      H = COMPLINACE_GUI_V1 returns the handle to a new COMPLINACE_GUI_V1 or the handle to
%      the existing singleton*.
%
%      COMPLINACE_GUI_V1('CALLBACK',hObject,eventData,handles,...) calls the local
%      function named CALLBACK in COMPLINACE_GUI_V1.M with the given input arguments.
%
%      COMPLINACE_GUI_V1('Property','Value',...) creates a new COMPLINACE_GUI_V1 or raises the
%      existing singleton*.  Starting from the left, property value pairs are
%      applied to the GUI before Complinace_GUI_v1_OpeningFunction gets called.  An
%      unrecognized property name or invalid value makes property application
%      stop.  All inputs are passed to Complinace_GUI_v1_OpeningFcn via varargin.
%
%      *See GUI Options on GUIDE's Tools menu.  Choose "GUI allows only one
%      instance to run (singleton)".
