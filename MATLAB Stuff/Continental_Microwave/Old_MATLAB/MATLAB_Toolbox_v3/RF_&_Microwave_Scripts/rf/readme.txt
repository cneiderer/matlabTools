This is a collection of MATLAB functions and scripts, and a Simulink model 
library, useful for designing and analyzing RF communication systems.  The
block library was originally intended for use in simulating a GPS system.
However, the GPS blocks are incomplete and untested due to the abandonment 
of the GPS project.

No claims or guarantees are made as to the accuracy, completeness, or 
fitness for a given task.  In addition, it is possible that the work of 
others has inadvertantly crept into this collection without the proper 
citation.  If this is in fact the case, I apologize in advance, and will 
correct such errors (and indeed all other errors, as time permits) as they
are brought to my attention.

All MATLAB functions and scripts should be adequately commented.  All 
SIMULINK blocks should have at least a short help message.  If it is brought 
to my attention that I have left something uncommented, I will correct the
omission as time permits.

I can only offer suggestions and help on a limited basis, as my current
project does not rely on the work collected here.  I can be reached via
email at harv0077@tc.umn.edu.
