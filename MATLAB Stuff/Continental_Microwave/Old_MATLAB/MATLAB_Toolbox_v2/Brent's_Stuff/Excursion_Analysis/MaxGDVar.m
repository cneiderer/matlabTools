function [w1MaxVar,w2MaxVar,w3MaxVar]=MaxGDVar(fDV,GDV,lengthw1,lengthw2,lengthw3)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%This function accepts a frequency array(fDV), group delay array (GDV) and
%the length of the w1, w2 and w3 bandwidths as inputs.  It then calculates the
%group delay variation (W1Var, W2Var, W3Var)for the W1, W2, and W3 specification
%specification windows across the entire measured data bandwidth.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%Separate the portion of the group delay array that fits within W1 by
%using the length of the W1 and assigning the
%corresponding value from GDV to the w1GD array.

    for ii=1:length(fDV)
        if test_array(i,1)==fDV(ii)
            w1GD(i-(indfminw1-1))=test_array(ii,2);
        else
        end
    end
end        

%Separate the portion of the group delay array that fits within W2 by
%using the length of the W2 and assigning the
%corresponding value from GDVto the w2GD array.
